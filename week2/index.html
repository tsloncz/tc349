				<h3>How I Work</h3>
			My favorite part about working with the web is the variety of tasks in any given project. Creating web sites requires the left and right brain to work together.  An interactive web site is just as much design as it is back end programming.  That is great because it allows me to jump back and forth and in and out which is how I prefer to work.  I work on the user interface until I get stuck, can't make up my mind or just get tired then shift to the more technical side of things and visa versa.

				<h3>My Web Development Environment</h3>
					My development environment has three main components; the editor, browser, and source control.  TextMate is the main content editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I test pages in Google Chrome and use it's developer tools to debug. Source control is done via github. I also have other projects going with Netbeans and Dreamweaver.
